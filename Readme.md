This is a online html editor based on the w3schools.com editor.

Creating this project will teach you the basics of some markup, css and javascript. It will also give yoou an idea of how online editors are built.

Though this project is not as robust as the w3schools one right now. It currently only supports HTML. CSS and javascript functionality will be added later.

The tutorial for this project is made by zinotrust tutorials. Here is their social media:
